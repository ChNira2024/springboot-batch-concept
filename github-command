$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ChNira2024/springboot-batch-concept.git
error: remote origin already exists.

=>I got this issue becoz i have cloned this project from other github url..Then i modify based on spboot3.x...see the owner

niran@NIRANJAN-LAP MINGW64 /c/Workspace2/sringboot_batch_app (main)
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ashokitschool/sringboot_batch_app.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ashokitschool/sringboot_batch_app.git (push)

=>See already owner is "ashokit"..becoz of this i got issue..already exist...
=>So Change remote to YOUR GitHub repo (Recommended): git remote set-url origin <destination-url>
=>or u can remove existing then add ur url:  git remote remove origin 
=>Here i am changing...
